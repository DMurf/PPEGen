## Proposition

Every company needs some bonding and team building even [Forbes says so](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianscudamore/2016/03/09/why-team-building-is-the-most-important-investment-youll-make/). 

A nice bit of escapism for a team is pretending to be somewhere else and attempted to work together to beat the common challenge, to support this, of sorts, this tool was created. 


### Existing game

"Paranoia" is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) known for its satirical and darkly comedic take on a dystopian future. Over the years, there have been several editions of the game, each with its own unique features and updates. Here's a brief summary of each version:

#### First Edition (1984):

The original version, set in an underground city ruled by an insane and paranoid computer. Players are Troubleshooters tasked with maintaining the system and dealing with traitors and threats.

#### Second Edition (1987):

Expanded and refined rules from the first edition, providing a more streamlined gameplay experience. Introduced elements like secret societies and complex mission structures.

#### XP Edition (2004):

A reboot of the original game, introducing a simplified rule system and emphasizing a more fast-paced and humorous gameplay. It maintained the setting of Alpha Complex under the control of The Computer.

#### Paranoia XP: Imploding Now (2005):

An updated version of the XP Edition with additional content and rules for character creation and gameplay. Emphasized the humor and dark satire inherent in the game.

#### Paranoia: Troubleshooters (2017):

This edition returned to the original game's feel, focusing on a more lethal and challenging gameplay. Provided a gritty and darker tone compared to the XP Edition.

#### Paranoia Red Clearance Edition (2017):

Another contemporary reboot with streamlined rules and mechanics. It introduced "clearance levels" for characters, incorporating an element of social hierarchy within Alpha Complex.

#### Paranoia Perfect Edition (2023)

The newest, shiniest, most perfect version of the game.

Each edition maintains the core theme of a dystopian future controlled by an insane computer, where players navigate a world of secrecy, backstabbing, and dark humour, often in pursuit of conflicting goals while trying to survive the deadly missions and the wrath of The Computer.

# Boilerplate

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
